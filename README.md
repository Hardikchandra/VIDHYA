# V.I.D.H.Y.A – Virtual Intelligent Digital Helper for Youth and Adolescents

## 📌 Overview

V.I.D.H.Y.A is a **virtual AI teacher** designed to enhance digital learning for students in rural India. The system runs on a Raspberry Pi and provides interactive education support for **Classes 6–10**, using voice-based Q&A, face recognition, and an easy-to-use graphical interface.

The project was developed under **Unnat Bharat Abhiyan (UBA)**—a national initiative of the **Ministry of Education, Government of India**, facilitated by **IIT Delhi**—with the goal of promoting digital literacy in villages.

V.I.D.H.Y.A is successfully **installed and deployed in Baretha Village (Madhya Pradesh)**, where it has significantly increased student engagement, created excitement for digital learning, and helped improve school attendance. The project is currently undergoing **Patent Filing** through Amity University, Noida.
